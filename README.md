Optinal : 

1. You might need to change the path in \*.cpp (for example, E:\\github\\ bla bla)

2. If you want to run the project, type the following in the terminal which has lead to our .cpp path:

g++ std=c++11 (all the .cpp files) -o build, and then run the build.exe file

or you can add multiple .cpp files into project on your respective IDE, then hit the build button.

Will be updated...
